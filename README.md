# Game Agent Simulation

This is a simple agent simulation program that simulates the behavior of multiple agents performing actions.

## Getting Started

To run the agent simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent-simulation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd agent-simulation`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the simulation: `python main.py`

## Usage

The agent simulation program consists of the following components:

- `Agent` class: Represents an agent with a name, inventory, and log of actions performed.
- `ActionBundles` class: Provides a mechanism to fetch actions for agents and perform actions.
- `print_report` function: Prints a report of the simulation results, including the number of agents, actions completed, and total number of items.

To customize the simulation, you can modify the following parameters in the `main.py` file:

- `NUM_AGENTS`: The number of agents to simulate.
- `NUM_ACTIONS`: The number of actions to fetch for each agent.
- `ITEMS`: A list of items that can be collected by agents.
